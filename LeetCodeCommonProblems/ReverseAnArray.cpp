/*
* Problem: Reverse string
* Description: Given an array of characters, reverse the array in-place.
* Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/
*  
* Approach: two pointer were placed in the array, one at the start, other at the beggining, then the value at the start swaps with the value at the end,
*			the start pointer increases and the end pointer decreases, this is done until start is equal or greater than end.
* 
* Time complexity: O(n)/2
