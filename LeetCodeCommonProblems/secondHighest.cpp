/*
* Problem: Second Largest Digit in a String
* Description: Given an alphanumeric string s, return the second largest numerical digit that appears in s, or -1 if it does not exist.
* Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/second-largest-digit-in-a-string/
*
* Approach: first we verift that the char is a digit, then make it rest by '0' char so it converts to int. After, 
*			we keep updating the Largest number to keep track and be able to find the second largest, then we return it. 
* 
* Time complexity: O(n)
